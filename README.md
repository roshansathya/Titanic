# Titanic
On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

This project uses machine learning on the Titanic dataset to predict survival of passengers.
One of my first projects on machine learning.
I have used various algorithms with feature engineering techniques.

Please do let me know if I could have done any part of the implementation better.
